# Lab02: SDF Practice

Let's practice using raymarching and SDFs! You may work with a partner or even two for this one.

# Setup 

Create a [Shadertoy account](https://www.shadertoy.com/). Either fork this shadertoy, or create a new shadertoy and copy the code from the [Mushroom Puzzle](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/sstSz2).

# Puzzle

Do your best to replicate the following simple animation:

Extra credit:
Make the animation less terrible! More detailed model, color differentiation for the mushroom vs ground, clouds, etc.
